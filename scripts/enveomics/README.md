# Enveomics Collection

Scripts and reference libraries at [Kostas lab](http://enve-omics.gatech.edu).

## Prerequisites

The enveomics collection as a whole has very modest requirements, essentially a
*nix system with `bash`, `perl`, `ruby`, and `R`. Some scripts may require
additional libraries, or even external Software, but you'll be forewarned about
these requirements in the documentation accompanying each script. If you prefer,
you can also use the Graphical User Interface (GUI), that comes with additional
tests to let you know if your system is ready to use any given script.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The enveomics collection now has a graphical user interface! To learn more,
